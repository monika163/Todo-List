## Technologies used

This project was created using the following technologies.

#### Frontend

- [React js ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) - JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications
- [React Hooks ](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - For managing and centralizing application state
- [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) - To handle routing
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - For making Api calls
- [redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) - A JS library for predictable global state management
- [redux-thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk) - Thunk middleware for Redux. It allows writing functions with logic inside that can interact with a Redux store's dispatch and getState methods.
- [redux-devtools-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-devtools-extension) - Developer Tools to power-up Redux development workflow or any other architecture which handles the state change
- [Css](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - For User Interface

#### Backend

- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) -A runtime environment to help build fast server applications using JS
- [Express js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) -The server for handling and routing HTTP requests
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - For modeling and mapping MongoDB data to JavaScript
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Zero Dependency module that loads environment variables
- [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) - Provides a Connect/Express middleware
- [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) - It is responsible for parsing the incoming request bodies in a middleware before you handle it. Itâ€™s commonly used in web applications built with Express.js to handle form submissions, JSON payloads, and other types of request bodies.
- [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) - allow coders to run multiple scripts with one command
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - an auto-refresh the server on code change

#### Database

- [MongoDB ](https://www.mongodb.com/) - It provides a free cloud service to store MongoDB collections.
